# TextAnalyserApplication

A simple UI tool (JavaFX) for analysing, encryption and decryption of text.

These are my first steps with JavaFX. So content and functionality are limited. 
I decided to do this project in order to practice Java programming and working with UI-elements.

Goals to implement:
+Frequency-analysis
+Substitution Cipher (Ceasar Cipher and Vigen√®r Cipher)
+Decryption tools
