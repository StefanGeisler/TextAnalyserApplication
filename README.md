# TextAnalyserApplication

A simple UI tool (JavaFX) for analysing, encryption and decryption of text.

These are my first steps with JavaFX. So content and functionality are limited.
The project is segmented under the MVC design pattern. 
I decided to do this project in order to practice Java programming and working with UI-elements.

Goals to implement:

+Frequency-analysis

+Substitution Cipher (Caesar Cipher and Vigen√®r Cipher)

+Decryption tools
